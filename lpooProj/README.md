# LPOO_T7G5 - Text-based character ZELDA game

Our project consists of an adventure game similar to the first game of Zelda. The main goal of the game is (obviously) reaching the end of the map.
To get there you will need to defeat several (Very!) dangerous monsters and other obstacles.

This project was developed by Diogo Guimarães do Rosário (Up201806582) and Henrique Melo Ribeiro (Up201806529) for LPOO 2019-20.

# Main Features
We intend that the player is able to walk, attack, pick up items and interact with the environment in order to solve puzzles.

# How to run
1) Clone this repository
2) Execute gradlew run in the shell
